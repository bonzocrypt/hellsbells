## üéÅ HELLSBELLS Stealth Airdrop Campaign

As part of our early rollout phase, HELLSBELLS tokens have been selectively distributed to **26 wallets** through a staggered promo campaign.

This initiative was designed to:
- Promote healthy decentralization
- Seed the ecosystem with early access holders
- Test wallet responsiveness and token behavior prior to public DEX visibility

Token recipients were chosen across a diverse set of addresses to simulate early community engagement. No tokens have been sold or dumped, and all wallets remain in active standing.

This campaign is separate from the upcoming public launch, which will feature:
- Liquidity provisioning
- Trading via Raydium and Jupiter
- DAO-controlled governance evolution

Check back soon for the official launch date and roadmap!
